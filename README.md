## What This Repo is

Provides a bare bones template to construct a group assignment.
PDF documents are created using `unilur` which enables the creation of assignment, solution and student submission file in an integrated way.

I use `renv` to manage package dependencies.
After cloning this repository use `renv::restore()` to install the necessary packages to an isolated environment.
